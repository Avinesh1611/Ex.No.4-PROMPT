# Ex.No.4  
## Scenario-Based Report Development Using Advanced Prompting Techniques

## NAME: AVINESH P  
## REGISTER NUMBER: 212222060022

## PROMPT:

---Prepare a scenario-based report for Experiment 4 on Prompt Engineering. The report should cover the following prompt types: Comparative Analysis Prompt, Experiential Perspective Prompt, Everyday Functioning Prompt, Universal Prompt Structures, and Prompt Refinements (Prompt Size Limitations).

The scenario is: manufacturing automation using IoT devices and predictive maintenance to improve efficiency, minimize downtime, and optimize energy use.

For each prompt type:

1.Provide an example prompt related to the scenario.

2.Generate the sample response.

3.Present results from at least two AI systems (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Meta AI).

4.Compare and evaluate the outputs using any one evaluation method (e.g., rubric-based evaluation).

## Aim  

To design prompts using Comparative Analysis, Experiential Perspective, Everyday Functioning, Universal Prompt Structures, and Prompt Refinements (Prompt Size Limitations) for an industrial automation use case, and evaluate responses from **ChatGPT** and **Gemini** using a rubric-based method.  

---

## Scenario  

**Use Case:**  
The manufacturing industry aims to reduce manual monitoring and increase efficiency through automation. The system will utilize **IoT devices** and **embedded controllers** to automate equipment, monitor performance, and enable predictive maintenance.  

**Objectives:**  
- Improve production efficiency by 30%  
- Minimize machinery downtime with predictive maintenance  
- Enable real-time monitoring and remote control  
- Reduce energy consumption  

**Target Audience:**  
Manufacturing companies in **automotive, electronics, and food processing sectors**.

## Procedure & Examples  

### 1. Comparative Analysis Prompt  
**Prompt:**  
*"Compare IoT-based predictive maintenance with traditional scheduled maintenance in manufacturing industries."*  

| AI Tool   | Response (Summary) |
|-----------|---------------------|
| ChatGPT   | Clear table format ‚Üí contrasts cost, downtime, accuracy. Explains predictive maintenance reduces unplanned failures. |
| Gemini    | More technical, with equations and sensor examples. Longer response, suitable for engineers. |

---

### 2. Experiential Perspective Prompt  
**Prompt:**  
*"As a factory operations manager, describe your experience when shifting from manual monitoring to IoT-enabled predictive maintenance."*  

| AI Tool   | Response (Summary) |
|-----------|---------------------|
| ChatGPT   | Writes as a first-person narrative, focusing on reduced stress, better decision-making, and improved uptime. |
| Gemini    | Similar narrative but more technical, mentioning cloud dashboards, real-time alerts, and integration challenges. |

---

### 3. Everyday Functioning Prompt  
**Prompt:**  
*"How does IoT automation in factories compare to how smart home devices like Alexa or smart bulbs function in daily life?"*  

| AI Tool   | Response (Summary) |
|-----------|---------------------|
| ChatGPT   | Draws simple analogy (factory IoT = home automation but scaled). Easy to understand. |
| Gemini    | Adds deeper explanation about protocols (MQTT, Zigbee). More technical than ChatGPT. |

---

### 4. Universal Prompt Structure  
**Prompt:**  
*"Explain predictive maintenance in simple terms with an example."*  

| AI Tool   | Response (Summary) |
|-----------|---------------------|
| ChatGPT   | Uses simple analogy: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like going to a doctor before you get sick.‚Äù Gives machine vibration sensor example. |
| Gemini    | Uses car servicing analogy, then explains in technical terms. Helpful for semi-technical readers. |

---

### 5. Prompt Refinements ‚Äì Prompt Size Limitations  
**Prompt:**  
*"List 30 applications of IoT in manufacturing."*  
Refinement: *‚ÄúList 10 applications at a time.‚Äù*  

| AI Tool   | Response (Summary) |
|-----------|---------------------|
| ChatGPT   | Provides 10 applications per batch in neat lists, easy to follow. |
| Gemini    | Sometimes gives more than 10, groups them by category (safety, efficiency, energy). |

---

## Evaluation Method ‚Äì Rubric  

| Criteria                  | ChatGPT | Gemini |
|----------------------------|---------|--------|
| **Clarity**                | 5/5     | 4/5 |
| **Technical Depth**        | 4/5     | 5/5 |
| **User-Friendliness**      | 5/5     | 3/5 |
| **Structure & Formatting** | 5/5     | 4/5 |
| **Overall Score**          | 19/20   | 16/20 |

---

## Conclusion  

- **ChatGPT** performed better for clarity, structured outputs, and analogy-based explanations, making it suitable for **business managers and general users**.  
- **Gemini** excelled in technical depth and advanced details, making it suitable for **engineers and technical experts**.  

üëâ **Final Choice:** For customer-facing and training documentation ‚Üí **ChatGPT**.  
For in-depth technical planning and engineering analysis ‚Üí **Gemini**.  

---

## Result  

Thus, prompts were executed successfully, and outputs from ChatGPT and Gemini were evaluated. ChatGPT emerged as the best for **clarity & accessibility**, while Gemini was best for **technical detail**.
